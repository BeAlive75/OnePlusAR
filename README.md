OnePlusAR
========

This framework is a clone of the BeyondAR Framework designed to offer some resources to those developers with an interest in working with Augmented Reality based on geolocalization on SmartPhones and tablets.

Don't forget to check the [wiki](https://github.com/BeAlive75/OnePlusAR/wiki) and the [documentation](http://bealive75.github.io/OnePlusAR/doxygen/index.html) to get more information about how to use this framework.

OnePlusAR platform only supports Android (Google Glass included). The BeyondAR team are currently working to support other platforms.
